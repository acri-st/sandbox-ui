## Introduction

###  What is the Sandbox?

Sandbox is a service that allows users to develop applications and models using cloud based services and to ease the deployment to the collaborative platform.

The Microservices that make up the Sandbox project are the following: 
- **Auth** Authentication service tu authenticate users.
- **Project management** Project management system.
- **VM management** manages the virtual machines for the projects. These virtual machines are where the user manages their project and develops.
- **Storage** Manages the project git files.

### What is the Sandbox UI?

The sandbox UI is a web application that interfaces with the microservices that comprise the Sandbox ecosystem. It provides a user-friendly interface for testing, debugging, and interacting with various microservices in a controlled sandbox environment.

The Sandbox UI also uses a common library that contains interfaces to services and styling.
